# Sub_Missions
Missions rebuilt nearly ***FROM THE GROUND UP!***

The main reason why this had to be done was because the game relied on a propietary program called U-Script.
*What is U-Script?*
   It is a Visual Coding interface which wires connect to code "blocks" for ease of use while testing in-editor.
 Unfortunately U-Script isn't even on the Unity Web Store anymore and the code it produces in C# is practically unreadable!

By rebuilding missions ***FROM SCRATCH*** this permits for a far more powerful, and flexible implementation of what already exists with additional seamless C# extendability!
